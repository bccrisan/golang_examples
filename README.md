# Go language Examples 
Colection of golang basic examples from https://gobyexample.com/


Under `src/hello` are 3 files one of them being the binary built example (which can be totally be ignored), the others being the files need for this project.

`hello.sh` is a bash script that I usually run it on a screen and is looking for changes in `hello.go`, which is the source code that contains the GO examples? This is needed to make the development faster because I use Pluma to edit the code and switching between apps it's not very effective.


At the moment, `hello.go` contains the main function in which are called other functions with basic usage examples.
Each function is explained in comments and is pretty clear for what are they for.
